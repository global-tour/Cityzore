                                    <p>For products noted as a "Worry-free Shore Excursion", if you are not returned to the ship in time to board, we will arrange the necessary transport to the next port-of-call. This policy applies only to our contracted local suppliers and only when, through no fault or action of your own, you are not returned to the ship in time to board. The policy is void in instances where delay is caused by your own actions and/or you have deviated from the Cityzore activity or tour. You must supply Cityzore with correct arrival and departure ship information and ensure there is enough time (min. 2 hours) between the tour end time and the ship departure time. You must contact Cityzore directly to request next port-of-call transportation arrangements as customers cannot book their own travel. Cityzore will select and book travel to the next port of call (not to exceed US$1000 per person). In addition, if your ship misses a port of call or is delayed beyond the commencement time of your Worry-free Shore Excursion, simply contact Cityzore within 14 days. Pending verification of the ships actual itinerary, we will issue you a refund.</p>
